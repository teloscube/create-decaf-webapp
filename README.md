Create [DECAF](https://docs.decafhub.com/) Web applications with zero or minimal configuration.

- Create DECAF Webapp works on macOS and Linux.

- It may work on Windows, but it is not officially supported.

- If something doesnâ€™t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/teloscube/create-decaf-webapp/issues/new).

## Overview

```bash
npx create-decaf-webapp@latest my-app -a "My App"
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

> You can also install it globally with `npm i -g create-decaf-webapp`. But to ensure you always use the latest version, it is recommended to use `npx`.

Then open [http//localhost:3000/webapps/my-app/development/](http://localhost:3000/webapps/my-app/development/) to see your app.
